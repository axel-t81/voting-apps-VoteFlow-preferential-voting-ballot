# voting-apps-VoteFlow-preferential-voting-ballot

### Description
VoteFlow is an app that both (1) allows transparent, online ballots to occur using the prefernetial voting system, and (2) provides a graphical representation of the flow of votes under a preferential voting system, i.e. you can visually see the preferences flowing as candidates are elimiated from the ballot.

### Current Goal
Review code and see where we are and what's next, plus likely need to go back to original program design due to the age of the repo and time since last push.
